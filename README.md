# PONG made in PyGame
I wanted to learn a bit about PyGame, since i never / rarely used it, so i created a small project: PONG

## Controls
- Right player: W to go UP, and S to go DOWN
- Left player: Arrow key UP to go UP, and Arrow key DOWN to go DOWN
- SPACE to exit the main menu, and start playing
- ESC to exit the game, and go to the main menu
- Q to exit the Game from the main menu

## Features
- Full PONG game, all its features
- 120 FPS window
- Main menu
- score system
- The X button on the title bar works (idk why PyGame doesnt do that by default. most likely so that people can make save files before quitting)
- ### CAT
- ##### ~You can start the game without cat PNG...~

## Future Features
- AI Mode (possibly with different difficulties)
- FPS Changer / FPS Independent code
- Colors (Yes its easy to make, but its 1 AM üôè)
- Customizeable Background (Pictures and colors / Gradiants), and main menu cat
- Sounds
- Difficulties / Over time harder gameplay
- Make the code human readable, instead of having it harder than byte code (maybe i chose the Brainf**k language instead?)

## ~Bugs~
- Game doesnt reset when pressing ESC and entering again (i am lazy, ok?? i forgot to reset to variables when you exit üôè)

## How to install and play (Linux, Windows, macos)
- Install python and pygame [(Click here for a tutorial video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uOTEOJ48G8)
- Double click my file
- Done!

## How to install and modify
- Install python and pygame [(Click here for a tutorial video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uOTEOJ48G8)
- Install a code editor of your choice (i recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for PyGame)\

ALSO: why is the PyGame Y axis so weird? just go up instead of going into the negatives. #Make0-0TheButtomLeftCornerInsteadOfTheTopLeftCorner
